This is not meant to be a full blown boilerplate or kickstarter of any kind. It is simply just a few angular based files that I find myself frequently using here and there. Mostly for my personal use when I am kicking around ideas and do not need a full project kickstarter. I am considering making one, but have not had time yet. If you are looking for something more of a full blown kickstarter with a build system, unit tests and all the other bells and whistles check out ngbp or yeoman.
